Numpy is a general purpose array processing packagewhich can execuete various multidimensional array very easilyin a efficient waywith python and with a various databases
How we can work on numpy?
To implement numpy in pyhton we can understand in this way.
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,2,3],[3,4,5]])
print(a)
this will help to print multidimensional arrays using numpy
print("adding 1 to every element: ",a+1)
print("multiplying 2 to every element: ",a*2)
print("transpose of an array :",a.T)
print("to get maximum of array: ",a.max())
in numpy we can also reshape a array in a different orientation by-
a=a.reshape(r,c)
where r=row c=column
and in numpy axis=1 is called row and axis=0 is called column
